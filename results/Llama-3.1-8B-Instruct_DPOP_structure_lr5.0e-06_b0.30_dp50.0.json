It is a measure of how hot or cold a substance is. Temperature is a scalar quantity, like heat, but it is a more direct measure of the thermal energy of a substance. Temperature is often measured using a thermometer, and it is usually expressed in units of degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) or Kelvin (K).\n\n**Key differences:**\n\n1.  **Direction:** Heat is a transfer of energy, whereas temperature is a measure of the energy of the particles in a substance.\n2.  **Units:** Heat is typically measured in units of energy, such as joules (J), while temperature is measured in units of degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) or Kelvin (K).\n3",
