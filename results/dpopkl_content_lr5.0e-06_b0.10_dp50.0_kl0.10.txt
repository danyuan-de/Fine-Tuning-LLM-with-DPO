 ----- Policy Model ----- Policy Response: Step 1:\\When two waves of the same frequency have a phase difference of $\pi$ radians, they are exactly out of phase. This means that when one wave is at its maximum, the other is at its minimum, and vice versa. As a result, the interference pattern consists of a series of alternating bright and dark fringes.\\Answer:\\The interference pattern consists of a series of alternating bright and dark fringes.\\Step 2 (Optional - for deeper understanding):\\To visualize this, imagine two sinusoidal waves with the same amplitude and wavelength, but one shifted by $\pi$ radians. At any given point in time, the two waves will have opposite signs, resulting in cancellation. As the waves move forward in time, the phase difference remains constant, leading to a pattern of constructive and destructive interference.\\Note: The specific positions of the bright and dark fringes depend on the wavelength and the distance between the two waves.\\Step 3 (Optional - for advanced discussion):\\It's worth noting that this interference pattern is a special case of the more general case of two waves with a phase difference of $\Delta\phi$. In this case, the interference pattern consists of a series of bright and dark fringes with a spacing determined by

Input1: A parallel-plate capacitor ($5\,\mathrm{\mu F}$) is charged to $20\,\mathrm{V}$. Then disconnected from supply. Plate separation is doubled. Find new voltage across the plates.
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by
$$C=\frac{\epsilon_0A}{d}$$
where $A$ is the area of the plates and $d$ is the distance between the plates. The capacitance is proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.
When the distance between the plates is doubled, the capacitance is halved. The new capacitance is
$$C'=\frac{1}{2}C=\frac{1}{2}\left(5\,\mathrm{\mu F}\right)=2.5\,\mathrm{\mu F}$$
The new voltage across the plates is
$$V'=\frac{Q}{C'}=\frac{Q}{2.5\,\mathrm{\mu F}}=\frac{20\,\mathrm{V}}{2.5\,\mathrm{\mu F}}=8\,\mathrm{V}$$
The voltage across the plates is halved when the distance between the plates is doubled.

This is due to the alignment of the magnetic domains within the material.\\Answer:\\The property of a ferromagnetic material to retain its magnetization after the external field is removed is called hysteresis.\\Step 3:\\Hysteresis is a result of the internal magnetic domains within the material aligning with the external field and then remaining aligned even after the field is removed.\\Step 4:\\This property is important in various applications such as electric motors, generators, and magnetic storage devices.\\Answer:\\Therefore, the property of a ferromagnetic material to retain its magnetization after the external field is removed is called hysteresis.

Input3: A solenoid has 500 turns per meter and carries a current of $2\,\mathrm{A}$. Calculate the magnetic field inside it. ($\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{T \cdot m/A}$)
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by the formula $B = \mu_0 n I$, where $n$ is the number of turns per unit length and $I$ is the current. The magnetic field is given in teslas (T), the number of turns per unit length is given in turns per meter (T/m), and the current is given in amperes (A). The constant $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, which is equal to $4\pi \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{T \cdot m/A}$.
To calculate the magnetic field inside the solenoid, we can use the formula $B = \mu_0 n I$. We are given that the solenoid has 500 turns per meter and carries a current of $2\,\mathrm{A}$. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:
$B = \mu_0 n I$
$B = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{T \cdot m/A})(500\,\mathrm{T/m})(2\,\mathrm{A})$
$B = 4\pi \times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{T}$
Therefore
