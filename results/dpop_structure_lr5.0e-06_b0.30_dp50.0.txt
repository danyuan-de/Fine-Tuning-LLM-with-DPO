Input0: A $5\,\mathrm{kg}$ mass on frictionless track moves at $2\,\mathrm{m/s}$. A $10\,\mathrm{N}$ opposite force acts $2\,\mathrm{s}$. Final velocity?
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The force is opposite, so it is a negative force. The mass is $5\,\mathrm{kg}$, the force is $-10\,\mathrm{N}$, and the time is $2\,\mathrm{s}$. The acceleration is $-2\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$. The initial velocity is $2\,\mathrm{m/s}$. The final velocity is $0\,\mathrm{m/s}$.
 ----- Policy Model ----- Policy Response: The initial kinetic energy is $K_1=\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\Apply the work-energy theorem\\Work done by force is $W=Fd\\The final kinetic energy is $K_2=K_1+W=K_1+F\cdot d=\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2+FdSo, $v^2=v_0^2+2Fd/m=\tfrac{2Fd}{m}+v_0^2=\tfrac{2\times10\times2}{5}+2^2=4+4=8\\v=\sqrt{8}=2.8\,\mathrm{m/s}$
 ----- Expected Response ----- Expected Answer: <observation>A mass slows due to an opposing force.</observation>\\<insight>Acceleration $a = \frac{F}{m}$ (negative), $v = v_0 + at$.</insight>\\<think>$a = \frac{-10}{5} = -2\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$. $\Delta v = -2 \times 2 = -4\,\mathrm{m/s}$. $v = 2 - 4 = -2\,\mathrm{m/s}$.</think>\\<answer>$-2\,\mathrm{m/s}$ (reverses direction)</answer>================================================================================

Input1: A thermometer is taken from a room at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to the outdoors where the temperature is $-10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. If the thermometer reading drops by $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the first $20\,\mathrm{s}$, how long will it take for the thermometer to read $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, assuming Newton's law of cooling applies?
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The temperature of the thermometer is $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the room and $-10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the outdoors. The temperature difference is $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The temperature of the thermometer drops by $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the first $20\,\mathrm{s}$. The rate of cooling is $0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{s}$. The time taken for the thermometer to read $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ is $60\,\mathrm{s}$.
 ----- Policy Model ----- Policy Response: Temperature difference is $30^{\circ}\\Temperature difference is proportional to the difference between the temperature and the surrounding temperature.\\So, the rate of change is proportional to the difference between the temperature and the surrounding temperature.\\20 seconds

Input2: An electron is accelerated through a potential difference of $200\,\mathrm{V}$. Calculate its kinetic energy. (Charge of electron = $1.6 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{C}$)
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The kinetic energy of an electron is given by the equation:
$K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
Where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $v$ is the velocity of the electron.
The potential difference is given by the equation:
$V = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
Where $V$ is the potential difference and $v$ is the velocity of the electron.
We can rearrange the equation for potential difference to find the velocity:
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2V}{m}}$
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 200}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}} = 1.4 \times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s}$
We can now substitute this value into the equation for kinetic energy:
$K.E. = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \times (1.4 \times 10^7)^2 = 1.2 \times 10^{-17}\,\mathrm{J}$
Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electron is $1.2
 ----- Policy Model ----- Policy Response: The formula is $K=\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\And the formula for potential energy is $K=qV$\\Substitute $q$ and $V$ into the formula\\$K=\tfrac{1}{2}(9.1\times10^{-31})(\sqrt{\tfrac{2(1.6\times10^{-19})(200)}{9.1\times10^{-31}}})^2=
 ----- Expected Response ----- Expected Answer: <observation>Determine kinetic energy using the work-energy principle: $K = q V$</observation>\\<insight>Multiply the electron charge by the potential difference to obtain the energy</insight>\\<think>$K = (1.6 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{C}) \times (200\,\mathrm{V}) = 3.2 \times 10^{-17}\,\mathrm{J}$</think>\\<answer>$3.2 \times 10^{-17}\,\mathrm{J}$</answer>================================================================================

 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The speed of the water in the narrow section is $5.0\,\mathrm{m/s}$.
 ----- Policy Model ----- Policy Response: The flow rate is constant\\Use the continuity equation\\Speed in narrow section is $v_2=\frac{A_1}{A_2}v_1\\$5\ \mathrm{m/s}$
 ----- Expected Response ----- Expected Answer: <observation>Continuity for incompressible fluid: $A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$.</observation>\\<insight>So $v_2 = \frac{A_1}{A_2} v_1$.</insight>\\<think>$v_2 = \frac{0.04}{0.01}\times1.0=4.0\,\mathrm{m/s}$.</think>\\<answer>The flow speed in the narrow part is $4.0\,\mathrm{m/s}$.</answer>================================================================================

Input4: A $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ focal length converging lens is placed $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ from another converging lens of focal length $20\,\mathrm{cm}$. Neglect thickness, find the effective focal length of this two-lens system (lenses in contact formula not valid, must use lens formula).
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The focal length of the first lens is $f_1=10\,\mathrm{cm}$ and the focal length of the second lens is $f_2=20\,\mathrm{cm}$. The distance between the two lenses is $d=15\,\mathrm{cm}$.
The image formed by the first lens is the object for the second lens. The image distance for the first lens is $d_1$ and the object distance for the second lens is $d_2$.
The image distance for the first lens is given by the lens formula:
$$\frac{1}{d_1}+\frac{1}{f_1}=\frac{1}{v_1}$$
The object distance for the second lens is given by the lens formula:
$$\frac{1}{d_2}+\frac{1}{f_2}=\frac{1}{v_2}$$
The image distance for the second lens is given by the lens formula:
$$\frac{1}{d_2}+\frac{1}{f_2}=\frac{1}{v_2}$$
The object distance for the second lens is given by the lens formula:
$$\frac{1}{d
 ----- Policy Model ----- Policy Response: Their focal length is $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ and $20\,\mathrm{cm}$.\\Use lens formula.\\For the first lens, $\frac{1}{f_1}=\frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{1}{v_1}$, for the second lens, $\frac{1}{f_2}=\frac{1}{u_2}+\frac{1}{v_2}$.\\The effective focal length is $5\,\mathrm{cm}$.
 ----- Expected Response ----- Expected Answer: <observation>The power approach for separated lenses is $P_{\text{eff}} = P_1 + P_2 - d\,P_1 P_2$ in air.</observation>\\<insight>Where $P=1/f$.</insight>\\<think>$P_1=0.1\,\mathrm{cm^{-1}}, P_2=0.05\,\mathrm{cm^{-1}}.$ Then $P_{\text{eff}}=0.1+0.05 -15\times(0.1)(0.05)=0.15-0.075=0.075.$ So $f_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{0.075}=13.33\,\mathrm{cm}.$</think>\\<answer>The effective focal length is about $13.3\,\mathrm{cm}$.</answer>================================================================================
