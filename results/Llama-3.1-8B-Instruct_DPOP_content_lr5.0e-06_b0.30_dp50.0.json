In the context of chemical reactions, entropy change (\u0394S) is a critical factor in determining the spontaneity of a reaction.\n\n## Step 2: Relationship Between Entropy and Spontaneity\nThe spontaneity of a reaction is determined by the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G), which is a measure of the energy available to do work in a system at constant temperature and pressure.
