Input0: An electron (charge $= -1.60 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{C}$, mass $= 9.11 \times 10^{-31}\,\mathrm{kg}$) moves in a uniform electric field of magnitude $2.00 \times 10^4\,\mathrm{N/C}$ directed along the positive $x$-axis. If the electron is initially at rest, what is its speed after it has traveled $1.00\,\mathrm{cm}$ in the field?
 ----- Reference Model ----- Reference Response: The electron is initially at rest, so its initial kinetic energy is zero. The electric field is uniform, so the work done by the electric field is equal to the change in kinetic energy. The work done by the electric field is equal to the force times the distance traveled. The force is the charge times the electric field. The final kinetic energy is equal to the initial kinetic energy plus the work done by the electric field. The final kinetic energy is equal to one half the mass times the square of the speed. The final speed is the square root of the final kinetic energy divided by the mass. The final speed is $1.00\,\mathrm{cm}$ times the electric field divided by the mass. The final speed is $1.00\,\mathrm{cm}$ times $2.00 \times 10^4\,\mathrm{N/C}$ divided by $9.11 \times 10^{-31}\,\mathrm{kg}$. The final speed is $2.20 \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{m/s}$.

 ----- Expected Response ----- Expected Answer: <observation>The electron accelerates in an electric field opposite to its field direction.</observation>\\<insight>Force $F = qE$, acceleration $a = \frac{F}{m}$, speed from $v^2 = 2a\Delta x$ (initial speed 0).</insight>\\<think>$F = (-1.60 \times 10^{-19}) \times 2.00 \times 10^4 = -3.20 \times 10^{-15}\,\mathrm{N}$. $a = \frac{-3.20 \times 10^{-15}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} \approx -3.51 \times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$. Electron moves opposite field, so $\Delta x = -0.01\,\mathrm{m}$, but use magnitude: $v^2 = 2 \times 3.51 \times 10^{16} \times 0.01 = 7.02 \times 10^{14}$, $v = \sqrt{7.02 \times 10^{14}} \approx 8.38 \times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s}$.</think>\\<answer>$8.38 \times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s}$</answer>================================================================================
